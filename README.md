# BuckyGlowExamples
Arduino code for Bucky Glow

LEDonly:
 Upload this program onto the Bucky Glow to produce illumination patterns. Saved patterns from the Bucky Glow app 
 are copied into this program in the section title "INSERT PATTERN from BUCKY app here:" An example pattern is 
 included in the code.
 
 faderAll: 
 Upload this program onto the Bucky Glow to make entire dodecahedron 
  fade in and out of one color

faderIndividual: 
Upload this program onto the Bucky Glow to make individual pentagons on
  dodecahedron fade in and out with one color.
  
buckyApp: 
Upload this program onto the Arduino to use the BuckyGlow App.
  This program takes serial commands from the app to light up the
  dome and store up to 40 patterns. Enables user to update BuckyGlow
  patterns in real-time by clicking on the dome presented in the App.

CAPcontrol:
Upload this program onto the BuckyGlow to control LEDs with capacitive touch sensors.
  10 capacitive touch sensors can be connected to pins 2-12 as specified below.
